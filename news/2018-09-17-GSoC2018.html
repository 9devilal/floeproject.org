                <h3>Google Summer of Code 2018</h3>
                <time class="floe-date" datetime="2018-09-17">September 17, 2018</time>
                <p>
                    From March to August 2018, the Floe project participated in
                    <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/6584170814373888/#projects">Google Summer of Code (GSoC)</a>,
                    a global program funded by Google which focuses on bringing student developers into open source
                    software development. Floe team members mentored five students in a variety of projects, with the
                    aim of expanding the Open Education Resources (OER) community and building connections with budding
                    open source software developers.
                </p><p>
                    Interested students selected from
                    <a href="https://wiki.fluidproject.org/x/CwAOCQ"> projects suggested by the Floe team </a> and
                    submitted proposals based on these ideas. Once the five students were notified of their acceptance,
                    they were encouraged to engage with the Inclusive Design community and learn more about the
                    <a href="https://inclusivedesign.ca/">Inclusive Design Institute (IDI) </a>, the
                    <a href="https://fluidproject.org/"> Fluid Project </a> and Floe. At the end of the coding period
                    in early August, the students each prepared a final report summarizing their work and were
                    invited to present at a
                    <a href="https://wiki.fluidproject.org/display/fluid/Community+workshops"> Community Workshop </a> which was
                    <a href="https://idrc.cachefly.net/wiki.fluidproject.org/videos/IDRC_CommunityWorkshop_GoogleSummerOfCode_StudentPresentations_2018-08-15.mp4">recorded on video</a>.
                </p><p>
                    The projects that were selected for GSoC this year are diverse in quite a few respects. From
                    technical details like the programming language, framework and style to more obvious aspects like
                    their methods of interaction and presentation. That said, they all endeavoured to improve
                    accessibility in computing and aid learning. What follows is a brief description of each project
                    and a link to its author’s final report.

                <h4><a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5411955049758720">Import external data to MyL3</a> by Jeevan Prakash</h4>
                <p>
                    This project involved prototyping functionality to import data into
                    <a href="https://wiki.fluidproject.org/x/CQHBAg">My Lifelong Learning Lab (MyL3) </a>
                    from external sources allowing learners to track various factors of their lives and examine their
                    effects on learning. The available sources include Google Fit personal fitness data, weather data
                    including air quality from Open Weather Map, and location data for use with Google Maps.

                <p>
                    This project was to consolidate various third-party adaptive learning and learning support services
                    into one easy-to-use web service that can be accessed by tools like textbook readers, language
                    teaching apps or chat bots. Kunal added support for both dictionary and language translation services.

                <h3><a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5392240612999168">Inclusively Design & Build a Game for Kids</a> by Ria Bhatia</h3>
                <p>
                    This project was done in close collaboration with Dana Cappel from the
                    <a href="https://en.beitissie.org.il">Beit Issie Shapiro rehabilitation centre</a>.
                    It involved designing and creating a pair of games which were usable by children with diverse needs.
                    The first, Spifind, is a game where the player uses a spotlight to “catch” a spider within a scene.
                    The game was designed to work with eye gaze tracking hardware to control the spotlight.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Ria also put together a game called
                    <a href="https://build.fluidproject.org/lab/music-mania/">Music Mania </a>
                    for preverbal children with visual impairments in order to assist with the development of digital
                    literacy. In order to reinforce learning of the different keys on a keyboard as well as their
                    relative locations, Music Mania has a different musical instrument or note play with the press of
                    each key.
                </p> <p>
                    Ria wrote in depth about her experiences

                <h4><a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#4681180725641216">Playtown! Creativity through Exploration</a> by Christine Hu</h4>
                <p>
                    <a href="https://build.fluidproject.org/lab/playtown/">Playtown!</a> is a game which was inclusively
                    designed in close collaboration with Dana Cappel from the
                    <a href="https://en.beitissie.org.il">Beit Issie Shapiro rehabilitation centre</a>.
                    It was developed for use with switch interfaces, both via single-switch automatic scanning and
                    two-switch step scanning. Playtown! encourages play and free learning by allowing the player to
                    decide which parts of the game to tackle in what order. Christine conducted a great deal of research
                    into the inclusive design process, including reaching out to Dana Cappel independently before
                    acceptance as well as applying the guidelines in Floe’s
                    <a href="https://guide.inclusivedesign.ca/index.html">Inclusive Design Guide</a>. Christine also
                    summarized her development and learning process in a
                    <a href="http://blog.christinehu.org/">series of blog posts</a>.

                <p>
                    This project consisted of updating the online accessibility checking tool
                    <a href="https://achecker.ca/checker/index.php">AChecker </a> from running on
                    PHP 5 to PHP 7. AChecker runs an automated accessibility audit on a provided website, HTML file or
                    raw HTML code. Victor’s work included updating the database code and replacing parts of the program
                    that no longer exist in the new version of the programming language.
                    Victor wrote about his <a href="https://medium.com/@Victoralagwu/the-journey-as-a-gsocer-upgrading-achecker-week-1-15ed9f1b2fb0">experience with upgrading AChecker</a> for GSoc.
